# google_drive_in_file_explorer
Enables Google Drive for Desktop to show in Windows File Explorer, same as the way that OneDrive or DropBox does!

OneDrive and Dropbox both create non-removable shortcuts in the Windows Explorer sidebar - the same unfortunately cannot be said for Google Drive. The Scripts and Registry in this repository will make the necessary changes to allow for a Google Drive shortcut in Windows Explorer.

**Disclaimer: This was tested on Windows 11 Professional, Windows 10 Professional and Windows 8.1 Professional. Ensure you backup your registry before making any changes.**
